# AIDungeon2

This is a fork of the original AIDungeon, with the ProfanityFilter features removed. Vanilla AIDungeon scans and censors the output of the game, looking for expletives, sexual content, racial slurs, and others.

## This fork removes the profanity filter entirely.

Please note: if you are offended at all by the output that is produced, I encourage you to visit the upstream repository instead, and run that repo. I have no control over what is produced, and neither does upstream. You have been warned.




Below is the original summary.
